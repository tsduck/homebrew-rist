## Homebrew packaging for RIST

This temporary Homebrew tap is now **obsolete**.

The RIST library and tools are now available on macOS as standard [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) packages.

Installing RIST on macOS is now just:
~~~
brew install librist
~~~

If you had previously installed this temporary Homebrew tap, deactivate it before reinstalling the new official version:
~~~
brew uninstall rist
brew untap tsduck/rist
~~~
